# 1-Code-Refactor

In this project, I have refactored the code to an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. The code is much cleaner than how I found it originally and the I have ensured that there is a clear semantic structure for the HTML elements. There are also comments before each semantic HTML element on the page.
